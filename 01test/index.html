                <p>I made this with Next.js and it is hosted on vercel, I am still working on some of the backend. The ring in the background is something I am quite proud of. I made it with a javascript library called Three.js.</p>

            <li> <a href="https://logisticshorizon.com">logisticshorizon.com</a>
                <p> I made this with HTML and PHP and it is hosted on godaddy. I made this before I knew React very well but the backend is complete. It will generate quotes for shipping cars across the US. handles payments, and even emails.</p>
